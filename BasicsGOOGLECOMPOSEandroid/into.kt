//Welcome to KOTLIN DEvelopment _ Google
/*
Kotlin is a modern programming language that helps developers be more productive.
For example, Kotlin allows you to be more concise and write fewer lines of
code for the same functionality compared to other programming languages.
Apps that are built with Kotlin are also less likely to crash, resulting in a more stable
and robust app for users. Essentially, with Kotlin, you can write better Android apps in a
shorter amount of time. As a result, Kotlin is gaining momentum in the industry and is the
language that the majority of professional Android developers use.
